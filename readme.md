<h1>StanLang</h1>

<small>A language heavily inspired by my name.</small>


<p>
StanLang is an <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language">Esoteric programming language</a>
</p>

<h2>
How it works
</h2>
<p>
An example of printing Stan in the Stan programming language

```
sTaN stAN sTAN sTan sTAn staN sTAn STAn
```
Every capital letter is a bit and characters are represented by 2 stans or 2*4 bits which is 1 byte.
<br>
One byte is than transformed to a character using the <a href = "https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII_(tekenset)">ascii characterset</a>
<br>
<br>
The above example in binary would look something like this:

```
sTaN stAN sTAN sTan sTAn staN sTAn STAn
0101 0011 0111 0100 0110 0001 0110 1110
---- ----
 |     |
 -------
   |
   > becomes the number 83 if converted with ascii it becomes a capital S
```
<h3>Usage</h3>
```./StanLang <filename>```

Thank you for taking a look at another one of my very useless projects!

Also the compiler is probably written really bad for todays standards. :D
